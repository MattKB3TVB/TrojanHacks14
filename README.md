=============

Our project was to create a simple, addicting cross-platform game using the python library Kivy. The game involves four colored buttons and a colored instruction. Depending on the command, the player is required to press the button of the color of the instructions or the color described by the instruction. Although planned to have a timer for each round, the current version does not have a timer due to time constraints. 

=============

The code is essentially done but there are errors in compiling the button.kv file. The main.py file was relatively simple to implement but there have been problems understanding the Kivy Language used to generate GUIs so the code is nonfunctional currently. We hope to fix these issues at a later time when we have a better grasp of Kivy.
